# Python POCs

In this project, I am trying to add POCs in python as many as possible of any kind of programs can be added.

To execute that program, I have also created start.py which accepts program name as an argument.
You can see the list of programs which are accumulated in start.py by using following command.

`python start.py -h`

### Pre-requisite

Install all python packages using requirements.txt using following command
`pip install -r requirements.txt`    

### Programs
- Multithreading
- Basic DNN Tensorflow Classifier Program to detect the flower from three category
